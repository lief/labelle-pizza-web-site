[How to upload files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository); this gives you a tip for updated the menu PDF. I haven't tried but I presume you could upload a file named `labelle-pizza-menu.pdf` and it may replace the existing one. If not: delete the existing menu and upload the new one with the same name, before you [*commit*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#commit) the changes.

You'll need write permissions to do any of this.

Hope you're having a great day.
